Title: Network diversity iNterpolation/Extrapolation Estimation
Version: 1.0.1
Author: Anne Chao, Syuan-Yu Wang
Maintainer: Anne Chao <chao@stat.nthu.edu.tw>
Description: Provides functions for network diversity analysis. 
    (1) The iNEXT standardization for network diversity: computes and plots rarefaction and extrapolation of network diversity based on two types of standardization methods (sample size and sample coverage). 
    (2) The phylogenetic diversity estimation: computes and plots asymptotic phylogenetic network diversity profile as a function of diversity order (q-profile) or time (time-profile).
    Provides simple functions to compute and plot two types (sample-size- and coverage-based) rarefaction and 
    extrapolation of species diversity (Hill numbers) for individual-based (abundance) data
